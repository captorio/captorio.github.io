      <h2>Install Captor root certificate to device</h2>
<!--<p class="meta">13 Feb 2016</p> -->

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>If you do not need capture https traffic, can be turned off in settings (Uncheckbox <code>Preferences</code> &gt; <code>Capture traffic</code>), and then do not need to install Catpor root certificate.</p>

<p>Only need to install Catpor Root Certificate on the client device. (The client device is the source of the HTTP traffic that Captor monitors)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Captor relies on a &quot;man-in-the-middle&quot; approach to HTTPS interception. Captor generates its own certificates for sites, which it signs using a Captor Root Certificate. You will see a warning in your browser, or other application, because the Captor Root Certificate is not in your list of trusted root certificates. </p>

<p>You can choose to permanently trust each site&#39;s certificate, in which case you do not need to trust the Captor Root Certificate. If you would like to automatically trust every certificate issued by Captor, install Catpor Root Certificate to your client device. The guide will help you do this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you install the Catpor Root Certificate following the guide, but still see a warning in your browser or device, please check your system date and time that run Captor, ensure the time is not greater than your deivce time, and in Captor go to <code>Preferences</code> menu click <code>clean</code> to clean certificate cache.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drag the certificate file onto the Keychain Access icon or double-click the certificate file.</p>

<p>Select the <code>captor CA</code> certificate, and then choose File &gt; Get Info.</p>

<p>Click the Trust Settings disclosure triangle to display the trust policies for the certificate.</p>

<p>set trust settings to <code>Always Trust</code>, and then close the windows, If youâ€™re asked to provide a name and password, type the name and password for an administrator user on this computer.</p>

<h3>iOS Devices</h3>

<p>First set your iOS device to use Captor as its HTTP proxy in the Settings app &gt; Wifi settings. Then open Safari and browse to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080/cert</code>. Safari will prompt you to install the SSL certificate.</p>

<h3>Android Devices</h3>

<p>First set your Android device to use Captor as its HTTP proxy in the Settings &gt; WLAN settings. Then open Chrome and browse to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080/cert</code>, save the certificate, then touch the certificate that will prompt you to install the SSL certificate.</p>
